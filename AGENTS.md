## Product

- Product name: **Ah, There It Is!**
- Repository: `ah-there-it-is`
- Python package: `ah_there_it_is`
- Goal: a local-first personal inventory memory controlled primarily through natural-language text.

## Architecture invariants

1. The LLM never accesses or writes the database directly.
2. Existing entities are referenced by stable IDs in mutation operations.
3. An LLM may search and inspect candidates before choosing an entity.
4. Creating a new item, location, or category is an explicit operation; mutation tools must not silently create named entities.
5. Domain/service code owns validation, deduplication rules, identity, and transaction boundaries.
6. Every material inventory mutation must eventually produce a history event.
7. HTTP handlers and LLM tool handlers stay thin and call the same service layer.
8. Natural-language source text should be retained with resulting events where useful for audit/debugging.
9. Known locations and inferred/probable locations are different concepts and must never be silently conflated.
10. Prefer the simplest implementation that preserves these invariants. Avoid framework layers without a concrete need.

## MVP constraints

- Text only. No voice, Telegram, images, QR codes, PWA/offline behavior, or MCP in the initial MVP.
- SQLite is the initial database.
- Synchronous SQLAlchemy is preferred until concurrency creates an actual need for async database access.
- Search begins with exact/normalized matching and SQLite FTS5. Embeddings are deferred until real queries justify them.
- Keep the LLM provider behind a small application interface so providers/models can be replaced.
- Do not introduce LangChain, LangGraph, Hermes, or another agent framework for the initial tool loop unless the native implementation becomes materially complex.

## Development rules

- Work in focused feature branches and merge only after tests pass.
- Add tests with each behavior change.
- Do not add dependencies that cannot be exercised in the active development environment.
- Keep module imports side-effect-light; application creation belongs in `create_app()`.
- Preserve local-first operation. External LLM APIs may be adapters, never storage authorities.
